I highly recommed getting Likes Lab Standoffs for this, otherwise you will need to do a lot of adjusting and get your bed Level for this to work. Out of the box, they are not level at all.

<h2>Hot End Modifications</h2>
Remove the Hot End from the Printer(4 M3 Screws, 2 front, 2 back)
Remove the Case by 2 M3 Screws attaching it
Remove the Pobe, 2 screws attach it to the metal casing, then trace the wire to the board and fish the wire out of the casing
